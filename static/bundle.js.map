I'm a cyclist and web developer based in Montana. I use this as a space to keep track of my adventures in code(read: blog) and experiment with cool cool tech. So far, this site has been built purely with Reactjs and Bootstrap with some light css styling using Sass. If you feel like checking out any of the code, hit my gitHub. \"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReact.createElement(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"p\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{ className: \"lead\" },\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReact.createElement(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"a\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{ className: \"btn btn-primary btn-lg\", href: \"#\", role: \"button\" },\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Learn more\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\n\t});\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = Welcome;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 137 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar __WEBPACK_AMD_DEFINE_FACTORY__, __WEBPACK_AMD_DEFINE_RESULT__;/*!\n\t  * Bowser - a browser detector\n\t  * https://github.com/ded/bowser\n\t  * MIT License | (c) Dustin Diaz 2015\n\t  */\n\t\n\t!function (name, definition) {\n\t  if (typeof module != 'undefined' && module.exports) module.exports = definition()\n\t  else if (true) !(__WEBPACK_AMD_DEFINE_FACTORY__ = (definition), __WEBPACK_AMD_DEFINE_RESULT__ = (typeof __WEBPACK_AMD_DEFINE_FACTORY__ === 'function' ?
